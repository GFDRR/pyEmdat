# pyEmdat - efficient analysis of natural disaster data

pyEmdat is a library for analysis of the EM-DAT natural disasters dataset. It allows to:

* Load and clean EMDAT data

* Summarize disaster statistics by country (single time period & annual time series)

* Summarize disaster statistics by hazard type (single time period & annual time series)

* Combine with population and GNI data (via World Development Indicators API)

* Create choropleth maps.

## Documentation
Documentation for pyEmdat is available at: https://pyemdat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Background: EM-DAT data
EM-DAT is a global database of natural disaster events and impacts maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) at Universit√© catholique de Louvain. It is used widely to inform policy-making on disaster risk management: for example, it helps policymakers identify the disaster types that are most common in a given country and that have had significant historical impacts on human populations.

Researchers can access EM-DAT through CRED's website: http://public.emdat.be. The data can be downloaded by researchers (having created an account and agreed to applicable conditions). It comes in Excel format. pyEmdat provides a data structure and functions to efficiently load, clean and analyze EM-DAT data.

## Getting started
First, download EM-DAT data which comes in Excel format. Abide by all terms and conditions of CRED including downloading only the data you need.
Second, create an ``emdat`` object
```
from emdat_df import emdat
ED = emdat('home/data/my_EMDAT_download.xlsx')
```
Third, use `emdat`'s built-in methods to filter, group and aggregate the data.
Fourth, use the built-in `utils` to compare natural disaster impacts with population and GNI data from World Development Indicators.

## Examples
See example notebooks for usage.

## Quick example

```python
result = ED.disaster_stats_entire_period(1980, 2020, countries = 'Pakistan', disastertype = 'all', stats = ['total_damages'])
result.head().plot(kind = 'pie', y='total_damages', figsize =[4,4])
plt.title('Pakistan: total USD damages by hazard type (1980-2020)');
```
